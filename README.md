- **Navigation**: Responsive header with mobile menu

## Customization

### Theme Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `src/index.css` to customize the color scheme.

### Content
For a functional website, you'll need to connect this frontend to a backend API or use a headless CMS for:
- Blog posts
- FAQ content
- Contact form submissions
- Reviews/testimonials

### Animations
All animations are built with Framer Motion and can be customized in the respective component files.

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - Frontend framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling framework
- **Framer Motion** - Animations
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives
- **TanStack Query** - Data fetching and state management
- **Wouter** - Lightweight routing
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

## Notes

This frontend is designed to work with a REST API backend. The original project included a full Express.js backend with:
- Blog post management
- FAQ management  
- Contact form handling
- Review system

To make this frontend functional, you'll need to implement these API endpoints or connect to a headless CMS service.
